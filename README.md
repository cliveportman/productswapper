# Product Swapper
Whenever a product is added to the cart, this plugin checks for matching product types already in the cart and removes them. Use it when you only want a single product of each type in a cart. Select which product types to allow this behaviour for within the plugin's settings page.

## Next steps
The setting page has been created so product types can be chosen as swappable.
