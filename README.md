# Product Swapper
Whenever a product is added to the cart, this plugin checks for matching product types already in the cart and removes them. Use it when you only want a single product of each type in a cart. The plugin currently applies this to all product types.

## Next steps
The setting page has been created so product types can be chosen as swappable. Next step is to actually use these settings!
